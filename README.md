### Why we are researching

Luke enjoys academic research/analysis, believing that prior proper planning, due diligence, and a thorough understanding of risks is necessary to help architect and realise the Web3 vision, similar to testing code for vulnerabilities. He wishes to realise the vision of this initiative spawned at EthBerlin04 and believes support from JUST Open Source Stiftung will help.

He believes academic research/analysis toward achieving its vision will enhance how each of the JUST Open Source Stiftung principles are adopted and that providing automated support tools will help individuals and collectives focus on Web3 promises.

### What we are researching

#### Background

Previously we built an initial prototype called CodeKarma at EthBerlin04. The initial prototype command-line interface (CLI) tool parses, checks and reports on non-compliances based on the extent dependencies used in your code align and comply with rules mapped to a predefined manifesto plugin schema. The manifesto schema may include values of your own identity, JUST Open Source Stiftung values, Web3 values, DAO values, or Polkadot Decentralized Voices (DV) political stance values.

#### High-Level Goals of Academic Research

The high-level goals of our participation in the academic research grant will be to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across:
* Open-source communities

## Application Packet <a id="application-packet"></a>

### Abstract Summary of Academic Research (Research Abstract / Summary)

The detailed goals of our participation in the academic research grant will be to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across:

* Open-source communities
	* In-depth research/analysis of open-source ways that collectives may successfully detect whether entities are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos, specifically with open-source requirements, and that have or could be been grouped into decentralized collectives with shared ownership, and open-source ways to manage and reform those entities.

### Objectives

The initial Objectives of what we are hoping to accomplish with this grant shall be as described in the "Abstract Summary of Academic Research" section.

#### Definition and Measurement of Success

The definition and measurement of success for this project shall be:
* Establishment
	* Creation of a multisignature research/analysis account on one or more Web3 decentralised software platforms
	* Creation of a research/analysis account on Web2 social media platforms (e.g. https://grillapp.net/@luke) to migrate the audience to Web3 decentralised software platforms (e.g. Joystream)
* Design Algorithm Theories from Specifications
	* Creation of formal problem specifications to be used as a black box
	* Design of algorithm theories to design algorithms from the formal problem specifications.
* Research/Analysis, Case Studies, and Optioneering
	* Journals and scientific studies
	* Real-world or fake entities
		* Research/analysis to include the discovery of, and a case study and interviews with at least one (1) real-world entity that is a decentralised collective with shared ownership, whose manifesto specifically has open-source requirements. If such a real-world entity (preferred) cannot be found, or is deemed to have been inadequately misaligned and non-compliant with its manifesto, specifically with open-source requirements, or permission to use any adequate real-world entity for the purpose of this grant is denied, or where access to that real-world entity is deemed cost prohibitive by the team, then the team shall create at least one (1) fake entity and at least one (1) fake manifesto, where that fake entity is adequately misaligned and non-compliant with at least one (1) of those fake manifestos.
* Feasibility Studies
	* Feasibility studies with simulations to test for minimum viability
* Feedback
	* Feedback forms to assess and adopt constructive comments and feedback for continuous improvement shall have consistent overall positive sentiment from all key stakeholders in Stakeholder Group #1 (at least a monthly) and #2 (one-off)
	* Receive invitations to participate in further grant procurement, if possible
* Adoption
	* Improvement in the Web3 audience to demonstrate Web3 adoption by verified identities
	* Credit from adoption of the theoretical research/analysis by other Web3 researchers or open-source Web3 software implementers
* Reporting
	* Review/publish preliminary theoretical research/analysis progress reports, at least monthly, on the Web2 social media platforms and Web3 decentralized software platforms
	* Review/publish detailed theoretical research/analysis progress reports, at least a quarterly, that shall also mention the level of:
		* Adoption
			* Improvement in the Web3 audience to demonstrate Web3 adoption by verified identities
	* Review/publish work snippets on JUST Open Source Stiftung channels.
* Publications
	* Review/publish at least one paper under peer-review in a major publication by the end of the program, or if that is not possible, produce at least one paper under peer-review in our own new Web3 and open-source publication by the end of the program, and make that a major publication.
* Marketing
	* Market the paper to try to have it published in one or more major web magazines, or if that is not possible, market the paper and publishing it in our own new Web3 and open-source magazine.
* Presentations
	* Present the paper at one or more major Web3 or open-source conferences, or if that is not possible, present the paper at our own Web3 and open-source side-event associated with a major Web3 or open-source conference.

##### Stakeholder Groups

###### Stakeholder Group #1

* JUST Open Source Stiftung
* Open-source community
* Web3 ecosystem communities

###### Stakeholder Group #2

* Major web magazine, or the audience of our own new Web3 and open-source magazine
* Major Web3 or open-source conference, or the audience of our own side-event associated with a major Web3 or open-source conference

##### Example Potential Future Impact through Web3 Adoption by Web3 open-source academic researchers

Whilst not the focus of this academic research grant, our academic research findings could drive future academic research/analysis to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across other focus areas such as:

* Economic theory
	* Investigate the incentivization impact of different token systems and financial structures that are owned and managed by on-chain collectives to steer entities toward alignment and compliance with their manifestos
* Legal landscape and regulation
	* Investigate the most effective ways for collectives to detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with legal and regulatory manifestos, including open-source licenses, in different jurisdictions that affect Web3 to help businesses to navigate the evolving legal regulations in an automated manner to scale Web3
* Governance
	* Comparative analysis of the fairest and most effective consensus models and governance mechanisms (on-chain and off-chain) and strategic plans driven by them for collectives to use to detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos
	* Experiment to discover the fairest and most effective power distribution for collectives to use that detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos
	* Explorer potential legal, security, and other threats to the strategic plans
* Market forces, drivers, and trends
	* Cross-chain analytical market research/analysis into the impact on adoption that may be caused by the behaviour of entities that are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos and potential ways to improve and the extent of improvement that could be possible by detecting and rectifying the misalignment and non-compliance
* Identity
	* Research/analysis of ways to manage the extent of misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos securely and privately on the blockchain to allow those entities to access and control and improve upon their own data and reputation
	* Investigate the behaviour and impact in OpenGov and creator economies of entities (e.g. Polkadot Decentralized Voices) that are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos and ways to improve

##### Example Potential Future Impact through Web3 Adoption by Web3 open-source software implementers

Whilst not the focus of the academic research grant, our academic research/analysis findings could drive the following future implementations:

* Legal landscape and regulation
	* List licenses associated with each dependency and check for compliance against the manifesto
	* Create a hash of the aggregated manifesto version and associated source code to be able to prove compliance at a specific timestamp
	* Integrate misalignment and non-compliance detection using signature images
* Governance
	* Integrate with separate tool that checks whether the behaviour of identities in OpenGov aligns and complies with values in the manifesto plugin registry
* Open-source communities
	* Checks whether code you write yourself complies with values in the manifesto plugin registry
	* Integrate with separate tool that blacklists specific versions of dependencies due to misalignment and non-compliance discovered through crowdsourcing
	* Create headless UX compliance tests that specifically check for alignment and compliance with UX values from the manifesto plugin registry
		* Note: This may be used by the Polkadot UX Guild
* Identity
	* Provides guidance on how to write behaviour-driven development tests to increase the change that the code you write aligns and complies with the manifesto plugin registry to protect your reputation
* Miscellaneous
	* Integrate local Git continuous integration (CI) for automation
	* List dependency tree of a repository

### Outcomes

In order for this project to benefit the greater Web3 adoption and achieve outcomes that align and comply with the expectations of the Web3 and open-source communities, it will be necessary accomplish with this grant the outcomes as described in the "Definition and Measurement of Success" section.

### Grant Scope
