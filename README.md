### Why we are researching

Luke enjoys academic research/analysis, believing that prior proper planning, due diligence, and a thorough understanding of risks is necessary to help architect and realise the Web3 vision, similar to testing code for vulnerabilities. He wishes to realise the vision of this initiative spawned at EthBerlin04 and believes support from JUST Open Source Stiftung will help.

He believes academic research/analysis toward achieving its vision will enhance how each of the JUST Open Source Stiftung principles are adopted and that providing automated support tools will help individuals and collectives focus on Web3 promises.

### What we are researching

#### Background

Previously we built an initial prototype called CodeKarma at EthBerlin04. The initial prototype command-line interface (CLI) tool parses, checks and reports on non-compliances based on the extent dependencies used in your code align and comply with rules mapped to a predefined manifesto plugin schema. The manifesto schema may include values of your own identity, JUST Open Source Stiftung values, Web3 values, DAO values, or Polkadot Decentralized Voices (DV) political stance values.

#### High-Level Goals of Academic Research

The high-level goals of our participation in the academic research grant will be to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across the following Focus Topic and associated Categories:
* Open-source communities
	* Categories:
		* Successful community ownership
		* Collaborative creation on open source environments

## Application Packet <a id="application-packet"></a>

### Abstract Summary of Academic Research (Research Abstract / Summary)

The detailed goals of our participation in the academic research grant will be to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across:

* Open-source communities
	* Categories:
		* Successful community ownership
		* Collaborative creation on open source environments

It will involve in-depth research/analysis of ways that decentralized collaborative communities with shared ownership that are engaged in collaborative creation and building on open-source environments may successfully detect whether they are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos, and to manage and reform themselves to successfully overcome those challenges using Web3 and open-source possibilities.

### Objectives

The initial Objectives of what we are hoping to accomplish with this grant shall be as described in the "Abstract Summary of Academic Research" section.

#### Definition and Measurement of Success

The definition and measurement of success for this project shall be:
* Establishment
	* Creation of a multisignature research/analysis account on one or more Web3 decentralised software platforms
	* Creation of a research/analysis account on Web2 social media platforms (e.g. https://grillapp.net/@luke) to migrate the audience to Web3 decentralised software platforms (e.g. Joystream)
* Research, Case Studies, and Optioneering
	* Journals and scientific studies
	* Real-world or fake entities
		* Research/analysis to include the discovery of, and a case study and interviews with at least one (1) real-world entity through optioneering that is a decentralised collective with shared ownership, whose manifesto specifically has open-source requirements.
			* Note: If such a real-world entity (preferred) cannot be found, or is deemed to have been inadequately misaligned and non-compliant with its manifesto, specifically with open-source requirements, or permission to use any adequate real-world entity for the purpose of this grant is denied, or where access to that real-world entity is deemed cost prohibitive by the team, then the team shall create at least one (1) fake entity and at least one (1) fake manifesto, where that fake entity is adequately misaligned and non-compliant with at least one (1) of those fake manifestos.
* Plan for Data Analysis
	* Define Objectives and formulated Research Questions and Hypothesis
		* Creation of hypothesis and questions as formal problem specifications that clearly defines the topic of focus of the experiment to be used as a black box.
		* Scrutinize the hypothesis rigorously using critical thinking based on an in-depth understanding of the subject to ensure the validity of experiments rely on a robust and testable hypothesis.
	* Detailed Plan for Data Analysis
		* Design Algorithm Theories from Specifications
			* Design of algorithm theories to design algorithms from the formal problem specifications.
			* Select appropriate sample size and representativeness, statistical methods that are aligned with the research questions for quantitative analysis of the data, and software tools based on defined goals.
	* Feasibility Study of the research project with surveys, experiments and simulations to test the hypothesis for minimum viability, and determine whether it will be beneficial in terms of technical, financial, legal, and market aspects.
* Data Collection
	* Obtain enough information for scientific analysis whilst being impartial and avoid getting certain results.
* Data Analysis
	* Organise Data through cleaning and preprocessing depending on its quality
	* Validation through peer review to avoid potential bias and to ensure interpretation is within context.
	* Records kept for reproducibility, transparency, and reliability.

### Example Potential Future Impact through Web3 Adoption by Web3 open-source academic researchers

Whilst not the focus of this academic research grant, our academic research findings could drive future academic research/analysis to explore theory associated with ways to drive the most Web3 adoption across other focus areas and associated categories, such as:

* Economic theory
	* Investigate the incentivization impact of different token systems and financial structures that are owned and managed by on-chain collectives to steer entities toward alignment and compliance with their manifestos
* Legal landscape and regulation
	* Investigate the most effective ways for collectives to detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with legal and regulatory manifestos, including open-source licenses, in different jurisdictions that affect Web3 to help businesses to navigate the evolving legal regulations in an automated manner to scale Web3
* Governance
	* Comparative analysis of the fairest and most effective consensus models and governance mechanisms (on-chain and off-chain) and strategic plans driven by them for collectives to use to detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos
	* Experiment to discover the fairest and most effective power distribution for collectives to use that detect and rectify misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos
	* Explorer potential legal, security, and other threats to the strategic plans
* Market forces, drivers, and trends
	* Cross-chain analytical market research/analysis into the impact on adoption that may be caused by the behaviour of entities that are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos and potential ways to improve and the extent of improvement that could be possible by detecting and rectifying the misalignment and non-compliance
* Identity
	* Research/analysis of ways to manage the extent of misalignment and non-compliance of entities with their manifestos securely and privately on the blockchain to allow those entities to access and control and improve upon their own data and reputation
	* Investigate the behaviour and impact in OpenGov and creator economies of entities (e.g. Polkadot Decentralized Voices) that are misaligned and non-compliant with their manifestos and ways to improve

### Example Potential Future Impact through Web3 Adoption by Web3 open-source software implementers

Whilst not the focus of the academic research grant, our academic research/analysis findings could drive the following future implementations:

* Legal landscape and regulation
	* List licenses associated with each dependency and check for compliance against the manifesto
	* Create a hash of the aggregated manifesto version and associated source code to be able to prove compliance at a specific timestamp
	* Integrate misalignment and non-compliance detection using signature images
* Governance
	* Integrate with separate tool that checks whether the behaviour of identities in OpenGov aligns and complies with values in the manifesto plugin registry
* Open-source communities
	* Checks whether open-source code written collaborately by decentralized communities complies with values in the manifesto plugin registry towards achieving successful community ownership
	* Integrate with separate tool that blacklists specific versions of dependencies that have not been collaboratively included and maintained using open-source in whitelisted Web3 environments due to misalignment and non-compliance discovered through crowdsourcing through successful community ownership of those dependencies
	* Create headless UX compliance tests that specifically check for alignment and compliance with UX values from the manifesto plugin registry
		* Note: This may be used by the Polkadot UX Guild
* Identity
	* Provides guidance on how to write behaviour-driven development tests to increase the change that the code you write aligns and complies with the manifesto plugin registry to protect your reputation
* Miscellaneous
	* Integrate local Git continuous integration (CI) for automation
	* List dependency tree of a repository
